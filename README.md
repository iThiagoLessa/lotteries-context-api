# Lotteries Results

This project was created to my studies, it's a frontend application that shows the results from lotteries. 

In this first part, I improved other application using the context API.
You can see the application without context API [here](https://github.com/iThiagoLessa/lotteries/blob/master/README.md).

**Atention:** this giveaway is illustrative of an api test.
